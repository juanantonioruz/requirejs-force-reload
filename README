Demo to reload requirejs instance without browser reload

        This demo wants to show how you can force reload the
        requirejs files without reload the browser. It uses the
        require.onResourceLoad() function to grab all the files that
        participate in the app, and later uses the
        require.undef(id_file_name) function to remove the files from
        requirejs and then try  to load the main file again.

Here there is an online version
